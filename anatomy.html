            The raccoon is easily identified by its black face mask and ringed tail. The mask helps reduce glare while
            aiding in camoflauge, and may enhance night vision. The tail usually has 5 to 7 complete dark rings,
            alternating
            with broader brown or gray rings, that completely encircle the tail and end in a dark tip. The tail is used
            as
            fat storage (of particular importance in the winter), and as a balance when climbing or sitting. Their
            pelage or
            fur is long and dense, a grizzled salt and pepper that varies from grayish-brown tipped with black above to
            light gray below although color can vary with habitat from grey to reddish brown to golden or buff.
            Albinistic
            and melanistic individuals are said to be not uncommon. Their forepaws are unusually dextrous and sensitive
            and
            resemble slendor human hands but come equipped with 20 non-retractable sharp claws. Raccoons' body length
            ranges
            from 60 to 105cm. Their tails comprise about 42% to 52% of their length. In the wild, raccoons weight ranges
            between 5.4 and 15.8 kg (12-35 lbs., 25 lbs. average) but varies by geographic location, habitat and season
            (they may lose up to 50% of their weight over winter using up their bodies' stored fat. The adult males are
            usually heavier than adult females.

        Studies in the 1990s by the ethologists Stanley D. Gehrt and Ulf Hohmann suggest that raccoons engage in
        sex-specific social behaviors and are not typically solitary, as was previously thought.[129][130] Related
        females often live in a so-called "fission-fusion society"; that is, they share a common area and occasionally
        meet at feeding or resting grounds.[131][132] Unrelated males often form loose male social groups to maintain
        their position against foreign males during the mating season‚Äîor against other potential invaders.[133] Such a
        group does not usually consist of more than four individuals.[134][135] Since some males show aggressive
        behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big
        enough to defend themselves.[136]

        With respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons, Hohmann called their social
        structure a "three-class society".[137] Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of zoology at Weber State University and
        author of the book Raccoons: A Natural History, is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at least
        the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in North Dakota in 1978,
        males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well.[138]

        The shape and size of a raccoon's home range varies depending on age, sex, and habitat, with adults claiming
        areas more than twice as large as juveniles.[139] While the size of home ranges in the habitat of North Dakota's
        prairies lie between 7 and 50 km2 (3 and 20 sq mi) for males and between 2 and 16 km2 (1 and 6 sq mi) for
        females, the average size in a marsh at Lake Erie was 0.5 km2 (0.19 sq mi).[140] Irrespective of whether the
        home ranges of adjacent groups overlap, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season if
        food supplies are sufficient.[141] Odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and
        identify individuals.[120] Urine and feces left at shared raccoon latrines may provide additional information
        about feeding grounds, since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and
        playing.[142]

        Concerning the general behavior patterns of raccoons, Gehrt points out that "typically you'll find 10 to 15
        percent that will do the opposite" of what is expected.[143]

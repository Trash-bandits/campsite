            Studies in the 1990s by the ethologists Stanley D. Gehrt and Ulf Hohmann suggest that raccoons engage in
            sex-specific social behaviors and are not typically solitary, as was previously thought.[129][130] Related
            females often live in a so-called "fission-fusion society"; that is, they share a common area and
            occasionally
            meet at feeding or resting grounds.[131][132] Unrelated males often form loose male social groups to
            maintain
            their position against foreign males during the mating season‚Äîor against other potential invaders.[133] Such
            a
            group does not usually consist of more than four individuals.[134][135] Since some males show aggressive
            behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are
            big
            enough to defend themselves.[136]

            With respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons, Hohmann called their social
            structure a "three-class society".[137] Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of zoology at Weber State University
            and
            author of the book Raccoons: A Natural History, is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at
            least
            the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in North Dakota in
            1978,
            males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well.[138]

            The shape and size of a raccoon's home range varies depending on age, sex, and habitat, with adults claiming
            areas more than twice as large as juveniles.[139] While the size of home ranges in the habitat of North
            Dakota's
            prairies lie between 7 and 50 km2 (3 and 20 sq mi) for males and between 2 and 16 km2 (1 and 6 sq mi) for
            females, the average size in a marsh at Lake Erie was 0.5 km2 (0.19 sq mi).[140] Irrespective of whether the
            home ranges of adjacent groups overlap, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season
            if
            food supplies are sufficient.[141] Odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and
            identify individuals.[120] Urine and feces left at shared raccoon latrines may provide additional
            information
            about feeding grounds, since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and
            playing.[142]

            Concerning the general behavior patterns of raccoons, Gehrt points out that "typically you'll find 10 to 15
            percent that will do the opposite" of what is expected.[143]

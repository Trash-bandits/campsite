        Though usually nocturnal, the raccoon is sometimes active in daylight to take advantage of available food
        sources.[144][145] Its diet consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant material and 27% vertebrates.[146]
        Since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods, Zeveloff argues the raccoon "may well be one of
        the world's most omnivorous animals".[147] While its diet in spring and early summer consists mostly of insects,
        worms, and other animals already available early in the year, it prefers fruits and nuts, such as acorns and
        walnuts, which emerge in late summer and autumn, and represent a rich calorie source for building up fat needed
        for winter.[148][149]

        Contrary to popular belief, raccoons only occasionally eat active or large prey, such as birds and mammals. They
        prefer prey that is easier to catch, specifically crayfish, insects,[150] fish, amphibians and bird eggs.[151]
        Raccoons are virulent predators of eggs and hatchlings in both birds and reptile nests, to such a degree that,
        for threatened prey species, raccoons may need to be removed from the area or nests may need to be relocated to
        mitigate the effect of their predations (i.e. in the case of some globally threatened
        turtles).[152][153][154][155][156] When food is plentiful, raccoons can develop strong individual preferences
        for specific foods.[74] In the northern parts of their range, raccoons go into a winter rest, reducing their
        activity drastically as long as a permanent snow cover makes searching for food difficult.

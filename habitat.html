            Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical
            structures
            to climb when they feel threatened.[225][226] Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high
            concentrations of beech trees, as beech bark is too smooth to climb.[227] Tree hollows in old oaks or other
            trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are
            unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient, raccoons use burrows dug by other mammals, dense undergrowth
            or
            tree crotches.[228][229] In a study in the Solling range of hills in Germany, more than 60% of all sleeping
            places were used only once, but those used at least ten times accounted for about 70% of all uses.[230]
            Since
            amphibians, crustaceans, and other animals around the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of the
            raccoon's diet, lowland deciduous or mixed forests abundant with water and marshes sustain the highest
            population densities.[231][232] While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square
            kilometer
            (1.3 to 8.3 animals per square mile) in prairies and do not usually exceed 6 animals per square kilometer
            (15.5
            animals per square mile) in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons per square kilometer (51.8
            animals
            per square mile) can live in lowland forests and marshes.

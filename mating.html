        Raccoons usually mate in a period triggered by increasing daylight between late January and
        mid-March.[165][166][167] However, there are large regional differences which are not completely explicable by
        solar conditions. For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average, the mating
        season in Manitoba also peaks later than usual in March and extends until June.[167] During the mating season,
        males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during the three- to
        four-day period when conception is possible. These encounters will often occur at central meeting
        places.[168][169][170] Copulation, including foreplay, can last over an hour and is repeated over several
        nights.[171] The weaker members of a male social group also are assumed to get the opportunity to mate, since
        the stronger ones cannot mate with all available females.[172] In a study in southern Texas during the mating
        seasons from 1990 to 1992, about one third of all females mated with more than one male.[173] If a female does
        not become pregnant or if she loses her kits early, she will sometimes become fertile again 80 to 140 days
        later.
